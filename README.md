gerrit-scripts
==============

This collection of Python scripts contains various utilities for interacting
with the Gerrit code review system (<https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/>).

Disclaimers:
 * The scripts have been written mainly for use in the Gromacs project
   (<http://www.gromacs.org>), and may contain some things or defaults that are
   specific to the Gromacs setup, but should be easy enough to generalize if
   necessary.
 * The scripts have been tested against Gerrit Code Review 2.9.1 and 2.13.3.
